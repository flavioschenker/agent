Layer of abstraction:
Divide big problem in tasks,
Give smaller agents only one speciallized task.
Divide tasks into smaller subtasks
Subtask are only simple identification, segmentation problems. The rest is hardcoded

Divide an Conquer. Swarm principle. Auftrakstaktik (Mission command) vs. Befehlstaktik (Command tactics)

1) Show layer of abstractions
2) Show one big thinking model Qwen3-32B, smaller Agents Qwen3-0.6B
3) Compare with other methods. One vs all, many to many (Swarm), Single model, Big multicall model, DAG (my approach), LangChain, LangGraph, MCP, Function calling, guided_json decoding
